**We can create as many columns as we want by separating with columns**
**After the data type we can set it as NOT NULL 
USE <DATABASE-Name>
CREATE TABLE <Table-Name>(<Name of the data <Data Type>
); 

EX:

USE mydata;
Create table concept(employee_Name varchar(15) ,AGE INT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO concept(employee_Name,AGE)
VALUES('AN',20);
